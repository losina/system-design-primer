## Study guide

> Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).

![Imgur](images/OfVllex.png)

**Q: For interviews, do I need to know everything here?**

**A: No, you don't need to know everything here to prepare for the interview**.

What you are asked in an interview depends on variables such as:

* How much experience you have
* What your technical background is
* What positions you are interviewing for
* Which companies you are interviewing with
* Luck

More experienced candidates are generally expected to know more about system design.  Architects or team leads might be expected to know more than individual contributors.  Top tech companies are likely to have one or more design interview rounds.

Start broad and go deeper in a few areas.  It helps to know a little about various key system design topics.  Adjust the following guide based on your timeline, experience, what positions you are interviewing for, and which companies you are interviewing with.

* **Short timeline** - Aim for **breadth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **some** interview questions.
* **Medium timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **some depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **many** interview questions.
* **Long timeline** - Aim for **breadth** and **more depth** with system design topics.  Practice by solving **most** interview questions.

## How to approach a system design interview question

> How to tackle a system design interview question.

The system design interview is an **open-ended conversation**.  You are expected to lead it.

You can use the following steps to guide the discussion.  To help solidify this process, work through the [System design interview questions with solutions](#system-design-interview-questions-with-solutions) section using the following steps.

### Step 1: Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions

Gather requirements and scope the problem.  Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.  Discuss assumptions.

* Who is going to use it?
* How are they going to use it?
* How many users are there?
* What does the system do?
* What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
* How much data do we expect to handle?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?

### Step 2: Create a high level design

Outline a high level design with all important components.

* Sketch the main components and connections
* Justify your ideas

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to [design a url shortening service](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md), discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * [MD5](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md) and [Base62](solutions/system_design/pastebin/README.md)
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.  Address bottlenecks using [principles of scalable system design](#index-of-system-design-topics).

### Back-of-the-envelope calculations

You might be asked to do some estimates by hand.  Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for the following resources:

* [Use back of the envelope calculations](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/1/26/google-pro-tip-use-back-of-the-envelope-calculations-to-choo.html)
* [Powers of two table](#powers-of-two-table)
* [Latency numbers every programmer should know](#latency-numbers-every-programmer-should-know)

## System design topics: start here

New to system design?

First, you'll need a basic understanding of common principles, learning about what they are, how they are used, and their pros and cons.

### Step 1: Review the scalability video lecture

[Scalability Lecture at Harvard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W9F__D3oY4)

* Topics covered:
    * Vertical scaling
    * Horizontal scaling
    * Caching
    * Load balancing
    * Database replication
    * Database partitioning

### Step 2: Review the scalability article

[Scalability](http://www.lecloud.net/tagged/scalability/chrono)

* Topics covered:
    * [Clones](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7295452622/scalability-for-dummies-part-1-clones)
    * [Databases](http://www.lecloud.net/post/7994751381/scalability-for-dummies-part-2-database)
    * [Caches](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9246290032/scalability-for-dummies-part-3-cache)
    * [Asynchronism](http://www.lecloud.net/post/9699762917/scalability-for-dummies-part-4-asynchronism)

### Next steps

Next, we'll look at high-level trade-offs:

* **Performance** vs **scalability**
* **Latency** vs **throughput**
* **Availability** vs **consistency**

Keep in mind that **everything is a trade-off**.

Then we'll dive into more specific topics such as DNS, CDNs, and load balancers.

## Performance vs scalability

A service is **scalable** if it results in increased **performance** in a manner proportional to resources added. Generally, increasing performance means serving more units of work, but it can also be to handle larger units of work, such as when datasets grow.<sup><a href=http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html>1</a></sup>

Another way to look at performance vs scalability:

* If you have a **performance** problem, your system is slow for a single user.
* If you have a **scalability** problem, your system is fast for a single user but slow under heavy load.

### Source(s) and further reading

* [A word on scalability](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/03/a_word_on_scalability.html)
* [Scalability, availability, stability, patterns](http://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)

## Latency vs throughput

**Latency** is the time to perform some action or to produce some result.

**Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit of time.

Generally, you should aim for **maximal throughput** with **acceptable latency**.

### Source(s) and further reading

* [Understanding latency vs throughput](https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/sd/archive/2010/09/13/understanding-latency-vs-throughput)

## Availability vs consistency

### CAP theorem

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/bgLMI2u.png">
  <br/>
  <i><a href=http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited>Source: CAP theorem revisited</a></i>
</p>

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

* **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
* **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

*Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.*

#### CP - consistency and partition tolerance

Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

#### AP - availability and partition tolerance

Responses return the most readily available version of the data available on any node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.

## Consistency patterns

With multiple copies of the same data, we are faced with options on how to synchronize them so clients have a consistent view of the data.  Recall the definition of consistency from the [CAP theorem](#cap-theorem) - Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

### Weak consistency

After a write, reads may or may not see it.  A best effort a
